    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model\u2019s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",

    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."

      "The best way to write a loop in Python largely depends on what you want to achieve. However, here are some general tips and common practices to help you write effective and readable loops:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Choose the Right Loop Type**: \n",
      "   - Use a `for` loop when you need to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
      "   - Use a `while` loop when you want to repeat an action as long as a certain condition is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use Meaningful Variable Names**:\n",
      "   - Choose descriptive names for your loop variables to make your code easier to read and understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Keep the Loop Body Simple**:\n",
      "   - Try to keep the logic inside the loop straightforward and concise. If the loop body becomes complex, consider moving some of the logic into a separate function.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use Built-in Functions**:\n",
      "   - Take advantage of Python's built-in functions and iterators, such as `enumerate()`, `zip()`, and list comprehensions, for more concise and efficient code.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Avoid Unnecessary Computations**:\n",
      "   - If your loop performs the same calculation multiple times, try to compute it outside the loop instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here\u2019s a basic example using a `for` loop:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a for loop\n",

      "Response: The 'Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem' refers to the tendency of CEOs or startup founders to hire weaker executives in the functions where they themselves excel. This happens when a CEO, having come from a specific area such as product management, sales, or marketing, chooses to hire a less capable individual for that role. The underlying issue is that the CEO has difficulty letting go of the function that initially brought them success, leading to hiring someone weak so they can maintain control and continue to be perceived as the strong figure in that area. This phenomenon is illustrated by the example of Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who, despite his capabilities in television, oversaw a situation where ABC fell to fourth place under his management, highlighting the consequences of such hiring practices.\n",
